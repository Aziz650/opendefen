            The consortium made up of Dragados 
            Offshore – a subsidiary of Cobra IS – 
            and Siemens Energy has been awarded by 
            TenneT (the Dutch-German transmission system operator) 
            a contract to design, build and install the three offshore 
            windfarm energy converter platforms in the North Sea.

            The converter platforms will collect the alternating
            current generated by several wind farms and convert 
            it into high voltage direct current (HVDC) which 
            will then be reconverted into alternating current 
            at onshore stations approximately 200 km away in 
            the German towns of Wilhelmshaven and Heide.

            The construction of these converter platforms, 
            each weighing around 34,000 tonnes, will generate 
            more than 2,000 jobs per platform providing workload 
            until 2031. This project is part of Germany's Energy 
            Transition Plan, which calls for the construction of 
            a major offshore wind power generation network. 
            Dragados Offshore was recently awarded six other 
            HVDC projects of the same type.
